This is HEVEA, version 2.32, a fast Latex to HTML translator.


ADVERTISEMENT
    HEVEA is a LaTeX to HTML translator.  The input language is a fairly
    complete subset of LaTeX2e (old LaTeX style is also accepted) and the
    output language is HTML that is (hopefully) correct with respect to
    version 5.

    Exotic symbols are translated into the so-called HTML 'entities',
    in other words into references to UNICODE chararacters.

    HEVEA understands LaTeX macro definitions. Simple user style
    files are understood with little or no modifications.
    Furthermore, HEVEA customization is done by writing LaTeX code.
    
    HEVEA is written in OCaml, as many lexers. It is quite fast
    and flexible. Using HEVEA it is possible to translate large documents
    such as manuals, books, etc. very quickly. All documents are
    translated as one single HTML file. Then, the output file can be cut
    into smaller files, using the companion program HACHA.

REQUIREMENTS
     HEVEA is written in Objective Caml version 3.12 or later
     (OCaml). It compiles under OCaml, which should thus be properly
     installed.

     More information on OCaml can be found at
       http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/

     However there exists binary distributions of HEVEA for PCs
     Those are provided by external packagers, see hevea home page
     for a (partial) list.

     There also exist a Win-32 distribution, by Philip A. Viton, see
     http://facweb.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/pviton/support/hevea.html

    HEVEA is fully functional when other software are installed
     * A modern LaTeX installation including dvips.
     * The ghostcript Postcript interpreter.
     * the netpbm image processing package.
       ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM
    However, these softwares are optional and hevea runs without them.
    
INSTALLATION FROM THE SOURCE DISTRIBUTION

  Download the source distribution
    http://hevea.inria.fr/distri/hevea-2.32.tar.gz

  Unzip,
    gunzip hevea-2.32.tar.gz

  Untar,
    tar xf  hevea-2.32.tar

  Go to the source directory
    cd hevea-2.32

CONFIGURATION
    There are a few configuration variables at the beginning of
    the Makefile.
     * TARGET

      TARGET=opt makes hevea compile under ocamlopt, the
      OCaml compiler that produces native code. This is
      the default.

      TARGET=byte makes hevea compile under ocamlc, the
      OCaml compiler that produces bytecode.

      Using opt, hevea is about three times faster than
      using byte. However, some OCaml installations may only
      provide ocamlc.

     * LIBDIR is the library directory of hevea, that contains
      hevea style files. It defaults to /usr/local/lib/hevea.

     * BINDIR is the directory where to install, hevea, hacha and
      imagen. It defaults to /usr/local/bin.


    

MAKE
    Once configuration variables are set, type:
      make 

   Then, install hevea binary in BINDIR and hevea library files in LIBDIR     
   (This might require gaining root privilege)
      make install

      
  ** Note that the hevea.sty file,  is simply copied to LIBDIR.
     It remains users responsability to make it accessible to LaTeX.
     Some packagers make additional installation efforts as regards
     this file.

  ** hevea build now uses ocamlbuild by default, in case of trouble,
     try: 'make all-make'

   Once hevea is installed, you can remove the sources.


IN CASE OF TROUBLE.
  - You do need version 3.12 (or newer) of the Objective Caml System.
    Older versions of Objective Caml cannot compile hevea.
